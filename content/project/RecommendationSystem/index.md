summary: |2-
  * Imputed missings of 14 million samples, performed EDA to demonstrate data patterns.
  * Implemented two methods in Python to do recommending: applied SVD to decompose the user-item matrix to establish a rating system, and utilized XGBoost to build a multiclass classification model.
  * Evaluated the two models by MAP@7, and output feature importance to obtain most significant variables.

Distracted driving poses a constant and significant threat, contributing to a striking number of traffic accidents. To enhance driver safety, the automatic detection of distracted behaviors becomes crucial. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of both detecting the presence of distracted behavior and identifying the specific class of the behavior on a given dataset of driver images.
